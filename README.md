# Anti Captcha Sound
Anti-Captcha by Sound Classificiation using ML

## Motivation
I was developing a simple [script](https://github.com/gooday2die/CulturelandPython).  It was working well.  However all of a sudden, it seemed that the developers from the official page did not like what I was doing. They added a captcha. So it is time for me to solve the captcha as well.

## Before we start...
This captcha solver is meant to be working for **Text Captcha**s. For Google's Recaptcha, this will not be a solution. Also, this is just a bunch of tests and things going on, so might have some overfitting or inaccurate results.

## The Idea!

![Captcha Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooday2die/Anti-Captcha-Sound/main/github/pics/example_1.png)

The image up there is a example of captcha (generated by captcha.org). There is an option that makes you **hear** the letters from the image. (For your information, I even sometimes cannot enter captcha correct without those sounds :confused:)

So, the main idea of solving a captcha came from this **hearing** sounds from captcha. The captcha is designed in a way that OCRs are not able to read the letters. (Tried solving with image recognition, however it had really really bad results). Using sounds to solve a captcha seemed to be okay,  so I decided to try that way.


## Dataset
The dataset that I used for training and evaluating this model can be found [here](https://github.com/gooday2die/Captcha-Dataset). Since there were no captcha dataset, I really had to label each data one by one for days. There are 500 images of total captcha letters and 500 sounds of total captcha sounds.

## Procedures
I really hate to use ML, however this seems to be the right subject to use ML instead of making an algorithm to solve the sounds. The steps are as it follows

### 1. Downloading the sound
When you inspect the sound hearing button, there is a HTML code that shows the `.wav` file. The example code is like below
```
<a rel="nofollow" class="BDC_SoundLink" id="LoginCaptcha_SoundLink" href="botdetect.php?get=sound&amp;c=LoginCaptcha&amp;t=2f43c84fa7e5fbb7afe7fcdb1fb347a4" title="Speak the CAPTCHA code" target="_blank"><img class="BDC_SoundIcon" id="LoginCaptcha_SoundIcon" src="http://220.149.231.241/captcha/botdetect-captcha-lib/botdetect/public/bdc-sound-icon.gif" alt="Speak the CAPTCHA code"></a>
```
Go and `wget` or download it.

### 2. Preprocessing the sound
The sound has lots of echos, noises, some wheird bass in the back going on so that it will be difficult for robots to hear. However, thanks to Python [noisereduce](https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce), we can solve this problem. The library [noisereduce](https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce) can reduce noise and echos. This will be much easier for our model to train with.

### 3. Training the model
Yes, I really hate to use ML. This is the step where you need to grab your `tensorflow` and `keras`.  This was be covered by `DoML.ipynb`

### 4. Test model with some data
After done training, I grabbed new sounds from the captcha and tried to see how it works using `ResultTest.ipynb`

### This is till now. 
Stay tuned for more updates!
