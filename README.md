# Anti Captcha Sound
Anti-Captcha by Sound Classificiation using ML

## Disclaimer
This was intended for educational purpose and academic research for myself.

## Motivation
I made a simple [script](https://github.com/gooday2die/CulturelandPython). It worked well for a while until the devs there added a captcha. So it is time for me to solve the captcha as well.

## Before we start...
This captcha solver is meant to be working for **Text Captcha**s. For Google's Recaptcha, this will not be a solution. Also, this is just a bunch of tests and things going on, so might have some overfitting or inaccurate results.

## The Idea!

![Captcha Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gooday2die/Anti-Captcha-Sound/main/github/pics/example_1.png)

The image up there is a example of captcha (generated by captcha.org). There is an option that makes you **hear** the letters from the image. (Fun fact: I even sometimes cannot enter captcha correct without those sounds :confused:)

So, the main idea of solving a captcha came from this **hearing** sounds from captcha. The captcha is designed in a way that OCRs are not able to read the letters. (Tried solving with image recognition, however it had really really bad results). Using sounds to solve a captcha seemed to be okay,  so I decided to try that way.
